# one-day-ahead-movement-of-stock-market-using-machine-learning-based-algorithms
Since the stock market these days are very dynamic, different financial prediction system have been introduced over the time using machine learning(ML) technologies for predicting the market. For the better forecasting of the stock market, selection of relevant input variables for this kind of system is a essential factor as various performance factors depends upon these inputs. In this work, we have selected the few technical indicators based on the technical analysis as inputs feature to predict the stock of very next day.This work is based on three major algorithms “which are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Random Forest Algorithm (RF)”.The performance of these major algorithms will be evaluated for various stock indexes on the basis of technical indicators.
